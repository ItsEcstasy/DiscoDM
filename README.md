# Discord Mass Messenger

### Overview

DiscoDM is a bot that lets you send messages to specific members or to members across an entire server

# Configuration

Edit **`settings.json`** to your prefrence, You can change things like, delay between messages, set it to target specific users or an entire server server, or the amount of messages sent to each user and more

# Usage

Set up **`settings.json`**
Once setup properly and ran, It will authenticate with Discord using your bot's token and send messaging according to the set configuration

# Functionality

- Supports sending messages to members across an entire server or specified users by their Discord UserID
- Allows exceptions to skip sending a message to specific users in the list
- Options to save member IDs or names to files (Make sure UseMemberIDs is true as it uses that file to mass dm a server)

# Notes

- Make sure your bot's token is in the **`settings.config`** and has permissions to send messages
- Make sure the SecondDelay and Repetition settings arnt too fast to avoid rate limits
